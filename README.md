# Project1HelloWorld
This is the first project in CS162. It just proves you can connect to our class, build a file, and push it back to github.


  Step 1. Create a new file named hello.cpp

  Step 2. Have it print "Hello World!" using cout, just like you've done many times.

  Step 3. Compile and run your code using the guide in the PCC Linux and Vim Manual. When it works. push it back to github.
